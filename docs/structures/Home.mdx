Corde structures are encapsulations of [Discord.js structures](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/master/src/structures),
exposing relevant data with a more detailed information about them.

Here you will find the definition of each property and function of the structures.

Each structure is _auto generated_, so if there is a need of change some information about them,
edit directly in the [source file](https://github.com/lucasgmagalhaes/corde/tree/master/src/structures).
