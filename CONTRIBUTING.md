## How to Commit

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) to padronize our commits

These are all common types used:

- **fix**: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
- **feat**: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type
- **build**: Something related with how the project builds.
- **chore**: Some trivial change that do not impact in nothing in the project or its docs.
- **ci**: Specific to continuous integration build.
- **docs**: a commit that change corde docs.
- **refactor**: a commit that refactor some code.
- **test**: a commit that add, change or remove something in tests.
